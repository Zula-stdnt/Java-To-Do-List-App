# Simple To-Do List App (Java Console)

This is a simple console-based To-Do List application written in Java. It allows users to manage their daily tasks by adding, viewing, removing, and marking tasks as completed. The program is designed using basic Java concepts such as arrays, loops, conditionals, and user input handling.

## Features
- ✅ Add new tasks  
- ❌ Remove existing tasks  
- ✅ Mark tasks as completed  
- 📋 View all tasks with status (Pending or Completed)  
- 📦 Fixed task storage (up to 10 tasks)

## How It Works
The application runs in a loop, displaying a menu that lets users choose what they want to do. It stores tasks and their completion status using two arrays and keeps track of the number of tasks added. It provides basic error checking, such as handling full task lists or invalid task numbers.

## Requirements
